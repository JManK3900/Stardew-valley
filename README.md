## Overview

This program will use a Priority Queue of abstract data type to simulate 
Stardew Valley a popular video game about the farming life. We will be using
Heap sort to get the MaxHeap that will contain all the tasks in order to 
represent the scheduling system.

## Reflection

So far I'm not enjoying this project at all, this for some reason
is so much harder than I thought it would be, like necessarily hard.
Again with the instructions, I have a hard time following them, I dont
know if its just me, but I don't see how people can get the required 
information to write the code from them.

In the end I don't even think I'll be able to finish the project,
as of right now, I've finished Task.java and MaxHeap.java, and I 
think thats all I'm going to be able to finish. Due to work I wasn't
able to go to many of the help sessions, which oh well. Overall, there
was nothing enjoyable about this project, and the worse think was
the increaseKey, because it took me until the day before the due date
to figure out what a key was, because nothing was very specific enough.
I do wish I started this a little earlier, i started around a week before
the due date, so I probably should have given myself 2 weeks due to my
work, so I will admit that part was on me.

## Compiling and Using

As of now, there is nothing to compile, the program does not work :(

## Results 

Not very good, so far nothing works because of unfinished files.
